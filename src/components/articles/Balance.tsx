        You want to eat junk food, so you should work out. You&apos;re stressed
        out, so you should find time to unwind. Maybe you have a tense and hard
        work environment, now humour becomes really important.

          Dealing with computers and strict boolean code, maybe we should
          balance that out with things that make us human.

        Hand out just a little more compliments, solve something as a group or
        pair. Simple things like being nice, respectful and open to
        anyones&apos; ideas.

        There&apos;s this idea of &quot;one and one is three&quot; that I like.
        Sometimes formulated as &quot;the outcome can be more that the sum of
        its parts&quot;.

        Say you&apos;re working on something by yourself, you work along and get
        done with the thing. Imaging someone else doing that task, they might be
        taking another route and achieveing slightly different results.
        That&apos;s &quot;one and one is two&quot;.

        Now imaging you&apos;re doing the same work, but together. You&apos;re
        brainstorming and discussing ideas, solutions and routes - the outcome
        may become something neither of you would have thought of individually -{" "}
