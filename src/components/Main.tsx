              Balance in life is important, right? It&apos;s like a clich√© at
              this point. You want to eat junk food, so you should work out.
              You&apos;re stressed out, so you should find time to unwind. Maybe
              you have a really tense and hard work environment, now humour
              becomes really important.

                Dealing with computers and boolean code, maybe we should balance

              It kind of goes hand in hand with boosting soft values in tech.
              Hand out just a little more compliments, solve something as a
              group or pair. Simple things like being nice, respectful, open to
              anyones&apos; ideas.

              The idea of &quot;one plus one can be three&quot; is something I
              like. Say you&apos;re working on something by yourself, you work
              along and get done with the thing. Imaging someone else doing the
              same work, but taking another route and achieveing a slightly
              different result. That&apos;s &quot;one and one is two&quot;.
            </p>
            <p className="font-sans text-base lg:text-[18px] text-gray-900 font-normal leading-[1.7] mt-[1.8em]">
              Now imaging you&apos;re doing the same work, but together.
              You&apos;re brainstorming and discussing ideas, solutions and
              routes - then the outcome may become something neither of you
              would have thought of individually. That&apos;s three. That&apos;s
              the level up that cooperation can lead to, and part of the power
              of valuing creativity and our human qualities.

                Playing music, I got a lot of free lessons about cooperation,
